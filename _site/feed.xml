        <title>Non-Conservative Forces</title>
        <description>
          
          Consider the basic force equation of classical mechanics When is derived from the gradient of a potential , this system is integrable. We have at least one conserved quantity (the Hamiltonian ) and the dynamics is restricted to some surface of constant energy in phase space. Once the Hamiltonian is...

        <title>Message Passing in 1D</title>
        <description>
          
          Suppose we have a 1D array of N spins on a ring, which can be either or . Suppose further that we fix one of the previously identical spins such that it is . Now inagine that between each pair of spins is a directed information channel that aims to...

        <title>Recursive Methods in Probability</title>
        <description>
          
          Problems can of course be solved in mutliple ways. Sometimes the natural, methodical solution to a problem is very lengthy, so knowing some tricks is useful. One such trick is recursive reasoning, which can prove useful in certain types of probability problems and puzzles. I like these methods since the...
