Roughly in order of interest. There are other things of interest but these are just possible projects/vague directions i could identify

<h2> Upper Critical Dimension (UCD) for Mean Field Rheological Models  </h2>

![Critical Exponent](/img/mf_crit.png)


<b>Background</b>
 
- Jie Lin and Wyart published <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.011005"> Mean Field Description of Plastic Flow in Amorphous Solids </a>, where they calculated an exponent $$\theta $$ that characterises the density of regions that flow plastically under small shear stress ( $$ P(x) \approx x^{\theta} ) $$. They calculate the exponent by using a broadly distributed noise term corresponding to the statistics of Levy flights. Their $$\theta$$ starts to agree well with simulation for $$d=4$$ (and greater, I assume) which is weak evidencefor it being the lower critical dimension $$d_c$$. They mention that they no Ginzburg-like argument is known for why $$d=4$$ is relevant. 
 - Model: discrete sites with stress values with rules for redistribution. $$x_j \equiv 1 - \sigma_i$$ where $$\sigma_i$$ is the stress on site $$i$$. Update rules are:

$$
x_i(l+1) = 1 \\
x_j(l+1) - x_j(l) = - \frac{1 - x_i(l)}{N-1} + \underbrace{\zeta_i}_{\text{broadly distributed}}
$$

<b> Directions </b>
- Development of Ginzburg argument. Criterion typically derived by considering fluctuations about the mean field bahviour starting from a free energy, but no free energy here. Effective one such as from a LD principle? Gaussian mixture modelling of the noise to replicate broad tail? if possible dimensional expansions for exponents when $$d < d_c$$. Could possibly link to other MF glass/rheological models (such as <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.2934"> HL-model </a> or  <a href="">Zamponi's</a> infinte dimensional glasses, where there are also no Ginzburg like arguments or dimensional expansions)



<h2> Memory and Resets with Large Deviations </h2>

![Stochastic Resetting](/img/reset.png)

<b> Background </b>

- There is a lot of unconnected work to do with memory effects in various stochastic systems. The most comprehensive work I've seen is by Christian Maez in <a href=" https://fys.kuleuven.be/itf/staff/christ/files/pdf/pub/gleresponsefinal.pdf "> Fluctuation-response relations for Nonequilibrium Diffusions with Memory </a> where they consider linear underdamped langevin equations with a memory kernel on the velocity damping term. In addition there has been some work to do with breaking detailed balance <a href="http://www.msc.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~vanwijland/PRE-98-062610-2018.pdf">without introduing memory</a> (Fodor, Hayakawa, Tallier, Wijland) 

- <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/aa5734/meta">Harris and Touchette</a> studied how discrete time stochastic resetting can lead to dynamical phase transitions (of both orders). They looked at  particular model with uniform resets, but have left out the continuum case, space-time dependent resetting rates etc and mention this as an interesting future direction

<b> Directions </b>
- Calculation of large deviation behaviour of space-time dependent resets for brownian particles. There is already a recent  <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.022130">path integral formalism</a> to deal with space dependent resets, so it may be relatively straightforward to apply large deviation biases analytically as well as computationally determine qualitative features of Large devitaion transitions in such systems. For a particle moving in a 1D potential $$V(x)$$ and with a spatially varying reset rate $r(x)$ the probability of no reset is 

$$
P_{\text{no reset}}(x, t) = \int \mathcal{D} x(t) \exp(-S_{\text{res}}[x(t)]) \\
\text{with} \\
S_{\text{res}} = \int^t_0 dt \Bigg[ \frac{ [(dx/dt) - \mu F ]^2 }{4D} + \frac{\mu F'}{2} + r(x) \Bigg]
$$

And biased probability distributions take the form $$ P_{bias} \propto e^{-\lambda A} P_{\text{n_reset}}$$. Would reduce to a hermitian quantum problem (as in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06986.pdf">Touchette paper</a> ) and may be able to say something about optimalling resetting choice for some defined escape times, confinement etc etc


<h2> Topological Mechanics for the Study of Disordered Networks </h2>

![Topological Mechanics](/img/topmech.png)

<b> Background </b>

- TopMech is the study of mechanical osscilators through the lens of topology. In particular it typically involves classifying/determining phonon spectra through the use of symmetry and topological connectivity of the system. <a href="">A review by Lubensky </a> speaks more about it and presents a basic 1D TopMech model that introduces the concepts. 
- A 2016 paper <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/SM/C6SM00875E#!divAbstract">Toplogical boundary modes in jammed materialsr</a> by Sussman, Stenuli, and Lubensky use the ideas of this field to look at the existence and nature of topological modes in jammed matter. Another, <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sm/c7sm00475c#!divAbstract"> Edge mode amplification in disordered elastic matter </a> by Yan, Bouchad, and Wyart looks at how extended floppy modes (which start at the boundary and propogate through the bulk of the system) can occur in disordered networks, They develop an approximate linear response framework to describe the pdf for the amplification of small displacments across the disordered system, focusing on the isotatic case  (with simulation results dealing with the hyperstatic case). Lots of analogies to 1D disordered electron channels. When $$\kappa$$ is the (normalised) amplification length across a system (such that $$ \vert \text{right edge mode} > \sim e^{\kappa} \vert \text{left edge mode} >$$, then the derived pdf is $$ g(\kappa) d\kappa = \frac{1}{2 \cosh^2(\kappa)} d\kappa $$ 

<b> Directions </b>

- Closer look at the connectivity statistics in disordered networks and how to affects amplitude of response analytically (are hyperstatic calculations typically very difficult?) 
- Continued study of the topologically protected modes within disordered networks (as a toy model for jammed granular materials).


<h2> Thermodynamic Models for Criticality in Classical Dipolar Gases/Liquids  </h2>


![Dipolar Liquid](/img/dipolar_gas.png)

<b> Background </b>

- Seminar by Paulo Teixara mentioned the Dipolar liquid as being the initial motivation for patchy colloid physics and that the properties necessary for criticality were unclear. All theoretical attempts at explaining strongly dipolar substences have treated mixtures of self-assembled chains in chemical equilibrium. <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/12/33/201/meta"> Teixara's review</a>  says that quite a few open problems exist. 

<b> Directions </b>

- Investigating how the anisotropic interaction changes the standard features of gas dynamics
	- Kinetic/Hydrodynamic theory: Development of a hydrodyanamic model from first principle using BBGKY heirarchy
	- Self organization: Investigation/characterisation of the system-wide percolating structures, fragility of solid structures formed by dipolar units.
- Free energy calculations for strongly dipolar fluids (although probably quite difficult as liquid theory is hard enough. Would be more heavily paired to simulation than others)
	- Predicting condensation for dipolar liquids

<h2> "Odd Elasticity" </h2>


![Odd Elasticity](/img/bending_wiki.png)


<b> Background </b>

- Vincenzo Vitelli has done preliminary work on the mechanics of elastic materials which exhibit "odd elasticity". This means that the tensor relatin stress and strain via $$ \sigma_{ij} = K_{ijmn} \epsilon_{mn} $$ is not even under the reversal of the first two and second two indices, but is in fact odd i.e $$ K_{ijmn} = - K_{mnij} $$. This difference to the normal symmetry can be related to active units within the materials in question, which are being experimentally realised. To my understanding, the elastic theory of such materials has basically never been studied.

<b> Directions </b>

- Work extraction properties of these elastic materials (although VV has some unpublished work on this in progress)
- Elastic wave propogation, stability analyses, dislocations, thermal properties i.e all the basic analysis but for systems with this new symmetry 


<h2> Self-Assembly through Liquid Crystal (LC) Patterning  </h2>

![LC Patterning](/img/LC_geom.png)

<b> Background </b>

- One route to assembly of 3d structures is through patterning 2d sheets with LCs, and then shining light/heating them to induce an ordering transition, which then buckles the flat sheet into the 3D shape desired. Differential geometry is the favoured tool for determining the resultant shape. The main difficulty is in developing an inverse solver i.e given a target 3d shape what patterning should I have. There are subproblems contained within this larger challenge

<b> Directions </b>

- Solving inverse problems without the constraint of aziumuthal symmetry. Kranthi Mandadapu from Berkely is developing a computational formulism for dealing with thermodynamic processes on curved boundaries and shape determination in elastic biological membranes. I think some of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782514005003">computational tools</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03907">methods</a>  he has written on potentially could act as a starting point to developing computational inverse tools for the LC system (if they don't already exist).
